### ROX: Rust Implementation of The LOX Programming Language

This repository contains the Rust implementation of the LOX programming language as described in the book
["Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). 

LOX is a dynamically typed scripting language designed for learning and exploration of interpreter 
and compiler concepts. This implementation aims to faithfully follow the language specifications 
outlined in the book.
